# Maze Game in Go + Ebiten

A playground sandpit for mazes using Go + Ebiten + fogleman/gg, based on ideas from Tetra Loops and PUCK MAZE.

Currently you can play "kitten herding".

Move the yellow blob around by throwing the ball (clicking on a tile),
and the yellow blob finds a path from where it is to the ball (if there is one).

Toggle the walls around the yellow blob using the WASD keys.

Turn the yellow blob into a wall-breaking bulldozer using the arrow keys.

Try to herd the kittens into the small area at the center of the grid.
