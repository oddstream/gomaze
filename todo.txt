Building WASM
=============
$ GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o ../oddstream.github.io/Herding/gomaze.wasm -x -ldflags="-s -w" -tags browser
$ GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o ../oddstream.github.io/Herding/gomaze.wasm -ldflags="-s -w" -tags browser
open a terminal in /oddstream.github.io/Herding
$ python3 -m http.server
(-m mod : run library module as a script (terminates option list))
open browser at http://0.0.0.0:8000/gomaze.html

$ cd ~/gomaze && /home/gilbert/go/bin/wasmserve -tags browser oddstream.games/gomaze
  (no need to build .wasm file first)

# to update go
$ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
$ sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.16.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz

[ ] remove deprecated APIs
	ebiten.Image.Size()
	ebiten.CurrentTPS()

Sacred Canonical Immutable
==========================
Single tap (no dragging, long taps, double taps)

TODO
====
[ ] black meanies
	start at corners of maze
	one per level to a maximum of four
	calculate path to puck
	path is recalculated when dest reached
	level restarts if meanie on puck tile

[ ] multiple pucks, red green blue yellow &c
	select grid.activePuck by tapping on an inactive one
	only grid.activePuck can move walls
	only grid.activePuck gets to puck.SetCamera()
	there is always an activePuck
	Tile.marked will have to change to a bit field or something, else the pucks follow each other's paths
[ ] puck can only carry one wall?
	the toggle wall mechanic is too fiddly for that

[ ] drag and drop puck(s) instead of throwing ball
	still shows path to be taken, though
[ ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban
	push blocks around to herd ghost kittens
[X] retire WASD to toggle wall
[X] puck carries a number of walls

? ghosts that hide in cul-de-sacs, different colors

+ score based on time, number of moves
+ menu becomes level select those unlocked
+ title, status bars
+ https://material.io/components/snackbars
+ popup menu when clicking on stationary puck (toggle wall, cycles between ne, se, sw, nw)

+ Rooms/open spaces

- don't fill in cul-de-sacs, corners become ugly

OTHER IDEAS
===========
Kittens has one puck and multiple ghosts. Try multiple pucks and one ghost?

Spider in a web; puck is a spider, ghosts are flies
	spiders can build webs, delete webs
	make baby spiders
	lay traps for flies, eat them later
	eat flies to increase health
	get hunted by predators (as do flies, spiders compete for them)
